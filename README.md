# Challenge 4: Web API Quiz

## Description

The purpose of this challenge was to build a timed browser quiz showcasing dynamically-updated HTML and CSS code that is powered by unique Javascript code.

## Usage

After inputting their initials, the user can start the quiz. The quiz and countdown then launches upon clicking the 'Test your Knowledge Here' button, which takes the user through a series of multiple choice questions. When the correct answer is selected, the screen moves onto the next question. When the incorrect answer is selected, the timer decrements by an additional 5 seconds. At the end of the quiz, the user is alerted of their final score.
